        "\n",
        "Yes, Djelloul, this is a very important question, and it opens the door to a real strategic discussion for a project like **Aetheris**, especially if your goal is to reach a large company such as **Damac** or **Sobha** (or even Emaar).\n",
        "\n",
        "### Direct answer:\n",
        "In a large real estate development company like **Damac Properties** or **Sobha Realty** in Dubai (based on the typical organizational structure of major companies in the UAE in 2026), there are usually **12 to 20 main departments** (departments/divisions), depending on the size and structure.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Realistic estimate of the main departments  \n",
        "(based on the organizational structures of these companies – Damac, Sobha, and Emaar as typical examples):\n",
        "\n",
        "**Common core departments** (usually 12–15 main departments):\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Finance & Accounting**  \n",
        "2. **Legal & Compliance** (very important due to RERA regulations)  \n",
        "3. **Sales & Marketing**  \n",
        "4. **Project Management / Development**  \n",
        "5. **Engineering & Design**  \n",
        "6. **Construction / Operations**  \n",
        "7. **Procurement & Supply Chain**  \n",
        "8. **Human Resources (HR)**  \n",
        "9. **IT & Digital Transformation**  \n",
        "10. **Customer Service / After Sales**  \n",
        "11. **Facilities & Property Management**  \n",
        "12. **Risk & Internal Audit**  \n",
        "13. **Corporate Strategy / Business Development**  \n",
        "14. **Hospitality / Leisure** (if the company has a hotel/resort division)  \n",
        "15. **Investor Relations** (especially if the company is listed or has large partnerships)\n",
        "\n",
        "**Specifically at Damac** (based on information available up to 2026):  \n",
        "They have a strong centralized structure with emphasis on sales, development, legal, and finance. The number of main departments is around **10–14**, with additional branches for large projects (such as DAMAC Hills or Akoya).\n",
        "\n",
        "**At Sobha Realty**:  \n",
        "Similar, but with greater focus on quality, interior design, and compliance. Usually **12–16** departments.\n",
        "\n",
        "**At Emaar** (the largest example):  \n",
        "More than **15–20** departments, because it is a much larger group (with divisions in malls, hotels, etc.).\n",
        "\n",
        "### Why is this important for Aetheris?\n",
        "If you want to reach Damac or Sobha, you need to understand that **Aetheris will need to interact with more than one department**, not just IT or Finance. Most of these companies make major decisions (such as purchasing a new financial system) through:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Finance** (the ones who will use the Ledger and liquidity tracking)  \n",
        "- **Legal / Compliance** (the ones who care most about RERA and escrow automation)  \n",
        "- **Project Management** (the ones who need milestone verification)  \n",
        "- **IT / Digital** (the ones who will integrate the system with their existing tools)  \n",
        "- **C-level** (CEO/CFO who will see the Pulse Dashboard)\n",
        "\n",
        "In other words, if your system covers **3–5 main departments** (such as Finance + Legal + Projects), it will be much stronger in the sales pitch and will significantly increase your chances of closing a deal.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Summary\n",
        "In a large company like Damac or Sobha, there are approximately **12–18 main departments** (not fixed, but this is the realistic range).\n",
        "\n",
        "The most important takeaway:  \n",
        "**Aetheris must be designed to serve more than one department at the same time** so that it becomes a “comprehensive solution” rather than just a tool for one single department.\n",
        "\n",
        "What do you think we should focus on now?  \n",
        "- Defining the **4–5 priority departments** for Aetheris (such as Finance, Legal, Projects, Compliance)?  \n",
        "- Or adjusting the milestones so they cover these departments better?\n",
